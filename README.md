# EdTech LLM: Question Answering System with Google PaLM & LangChain

This project is an end-to-end implementation of a question-answering system using Google PaLM and LangChain for Codebasics, an e-learning platform (website: codebasics.io) that offers data-centric courses and bootcamps. The system is designed to assist learners by addressing their queries, typically asked via Discord or email, through a Streamlit-based user interface, providing accurate and efficient responses.
